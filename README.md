A Noa example, using create-react-app. This example uses most of noa's features.

Getting started with local development:
```
(clone this repo)

cd noa-examples
npm install
npm start     # runs /src/hello-world
```

To build for prod:
```
npm run build

(then serve build folder with express or your choice of web server)
```

Have fun hacking!
